Summary: Tea is a much better beverage than Coffee. Here are a few reasons why.
Tea lovers swear by the comfort, variety, and health benefits offered by their favorite drink. Here are a few reasons why tea wins hands down over other popular beverages, including the ever-so-popular coffee.
First, tea contains less caffeine than coffee, making it a healthier choice for those looking to cut down on caffeine. In addition, tea is packed with antioxidants that help to fight off disease and promote a healthy immune system. While coffee also contains antioxidants, it has been linked to heartburn, indigestion, and increased anxiety.
Tea, on the other hand, is more gentle on your stomach, and has been known to soothe and calm the body. It is also a versatile beverage that can be enjoyed hot or cold- perfect for any weather or mood.

Lastly, tea has a taste for everyone - from mild and soothing chamomile, to strong and bold black tea. What's more, tea has been associated with lower cancer and heart disease rates.

So next time you're looking for a warm, comforting drink, you know which beverage to reach for - a hot cup of tea.

Summary: Learn how to brew the perfect cup of Indian chai with these tips and tricks.
Indian chai, also known as masala chai, is a popular tea beverage that has gained international fame. While there are many ways to brew chai, there are certain techniques that can help you perfect your cup of tea. First, choose high-quality tea leaves and fresh spices, such as cardamom, cinnamon, and ginger. Second, heat your milk and spices in a saucepan before adding the tea leaves. Let the tea simmer for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
In terms of brewing time, it's important not to over-steep the tea, which can lead to a bitter taste. Most chai recipes recommend steeping for 3-5 minutes. Lastly, strain the tea to remove any residue and enjoy hot with a sweetener like honey or sugar.
Whether you prefer your chai traditional or with a twist, by following these tips and experimenting with different blends, you too can become a chai connoisseur.

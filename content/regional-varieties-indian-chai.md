Summary: Discover the diverse regional flavors of Indian chai, from the strong and bold kadak chai of Mumbai to the fragrant Kashmiri chai.
While masala chai is the most common type of Indian tea, the regional varieties of chai are just as flavorful and unique. In Mumbai, kadak chai is a popular choice - this strong and bold tea is made by boiling milk, sugar, and tea leaves together. The result is a robust tea that is perfect for dipping biscuits or samosas.
In contrast, Kashmiri chai is a fragrant and delicately spiced tea that is brewed with green tea leaves, saffron, and cardamom. The addition of almonds and subtle sweetness sets this chai apart from others. The tea is also renowned for its pink color, which comes from the use of special tea leaves.
Moving south, the Chennai-style filter coffee is often referred to as chai due to its popularity. In Delhi, the chai is often spiced with peppercorns and cinnamon sticks, while in Kolkata it is often enjoyed with a side of savory snacks.

Exploring the diverse regional varieties of Indian chai is a great way to experience the country's rich tea culture. Each region has its unique take on this beloved beverage, making it an exciting world to discover.
